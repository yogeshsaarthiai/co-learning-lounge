</p>

Thanks for showing interest in taking part in our Co-learning activity. We assure you the journey full of learning by solving some problems. To get into the Data Science field, the first and the last thing you need is the portfolio where you have solved a problem using data science. Ask any good Data Scientist and they will tell you the same.

#### <div align="center">“Let’s put theory into practice”</div>
  

In this activity, we will solve old Kaggle problems to enable you to participate in ongoing Kaggle competitions.

#### **Why Old Kaggle problems?**
Kaggle is an amazing Data science community with competition from top companies that has a close to the real dataset, Quality discussion, and Solution. A gold mine of knowledge is already there we just need to dig it :)

# <div align="center">Course Outline</div>

## <div align="center"><ins>Prerequisite</ins></div>

- Should have basic knowledge of writing Python code.
- Should have basic hands-on knowledge of Deep Learning framework like [Keras](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/).
- Should have basic knowledge of Deep Learning concepts (Feed Forward Layer, Training & Evaluation, Loss, Optimizers)

## <div align="center"><ins>Batch Details</ins></div>

*For enrollment into any batch a one on one discussion session would be scheduled with our team where our team will understand your aspiration for joining this course and your understanding about field of Data Science and Kaggle.*

**In Class**

*Brush up would be done for basic NLP concept and in class live teaching would be conducted on a dataset.*

**Capstone**

*Whatever would be practiced in class that would be under the guided mentorship but knowledge is built up only when practice is done. In this segment an old kaggle problem which is NLP classification based would be alloted to learners to create and do hands-on practice with end to end NLP pipeline and be ready to participate in real time kaggle competetions.*

The whole idea is to mentor and guide you well in your Data Science journey. Like others, we don't want to give you **False hopes** and then fail at making a successful career transition. Also, once you join our course and after finishing you can solve plenty of Kaggle problems with help of close and premium community of Kagglers and guidance from mentors.

## <div align="center"><ins>Problems to be undertaken</ins></div>

**1. [**Quora Insincere Questions Classification**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification)**

*An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world. <br>
In this competition, Kagglers will develop models that identify and flag insincere questions. To date, Quora has employed both machine learning and manual review to address this problem. With your help, they can develop more scalable methods to detect toxic and misleading content.
Here's your chance to combat online trolls at scale. Help Quora uphold their policy of “Be Nice, Be Respectful” and continue to be a place for sharing and growing the world’s knowledge.*

**2. [**Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)**

*Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments. <br> <br>In this competition, you’re challenged to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s  [current models](https://github.com/conversationai/unintended-ml-bias-analysis). You’ll be using a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful. <br>
_Disclaimer: the dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive._*

## <div align="center"><ins>**NLP Introduction** (1 hours)</ins></div>

*It seems blind to jump right into problem statement without knowing the real and business usecase. Also it is very important to explore the synergy with other NLP related application and latest libraries.*

<U>Introduction and scope:</U>

1. What is Natural Langauge Processing?
2. Why it is required?
3. Applications
4. Companies - Domains working on solving NLP problems.
5. Popular NLP libraries

## <div align="center"><ins>**Dataset preparation** (3 hours)</ins></div>

*Unlike other dataset, text data set is hard to deal because it is highly unstructured and messy. Hence dealing it right initiallty is utmost important.*

<U>Understand the initial steps to deal with text data :</U>

1. Data loading
2. Data cleaning and pre-processing
3. Data splitting - Train & Test

## <div align="center"><ins> Feature Engineering & Word embedding  (6 hour)</ins></div>

*Because AI Models understand the structured and numeric data we need to convert our text data into its required format.*

<U> Learn the concepts and process of converting unstructured features to numerical feature to feed algorithm: </U>

1. Learn to create custom embedding using -   Count vectorizer, TF-IDF, word2vec
2. Understand the Transfer Learning using word2vec(CBOW, Skip gram), Glove, FastText, BERT etc
3. Implementation of suitable and latest word embedding using transfer learning

## <div align="center"><ins> Model building (8 hours)</ins></div>

*Now it is time to build the heart of NLP pipeline i.e Classification Model. It is entirely depend upon the architecture you choose.*

<U> Exploring old and latest model architecture with its implementation: </U>

1. Traditional ML classifiers
2. RNN
3. CNN
4. LSTM
5. GRU
6. BiLSTM
7. ULMFiT
8. Attention
9. Transformer

    
## <div align="center"><ins>Evaluation metrics (2 hours)</ins></div>

*Model validation for NLP with Deep Learning is different from traditional ML problems. Hence, we will take a detailed look into how to evaluate your traditional ML and DL - NLP model*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the performance of model based on several metrics : </U>

1. Traditional ML Models
-   Classification Reports
-   F1, Precision/recall, ROC-AUC
2. Deep Learning Model
-   Validation Loss
-   Accuracy (Smoothing)
-   Tensorboard Evaluations

## <div align="center"><ins>Hyperparameter tuning (2 hours)</ins></div>

*Once a ML or DL algorithm has been identified, it is imperative to choose an optimal set of parameters to tune the model to better fit the data. Such parameters can’t be learn’t during the training process and thus requires an expertise for model tuning.*

<U> Develop an intuition to streamline the parameter optimization process. : </U>

1. Traditional ML Models
-   Grid Search/Randomized Search
2. Deep Learning Model
-   Batch Size/ Activation Units
-   Hidden layer dimensions
-   Heads in Transformer models
